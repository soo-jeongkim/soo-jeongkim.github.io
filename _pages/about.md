Hi! This is Soo :) 

I am a first year PhD student at [EMBL-EBI](https://www.ebi.ac.uk/) and the [University of Cambridge](https://www.cam.ac.uk/), under the supervision of [Dr Isidro Cortes-Ciriano](https://www.ebi.ac.uk/research/cortes-ciriano/). I am interested in problems at the intersection of machine learning and biology.

I completed my MPhil at the [Department of Engineering](https://www.eng.cam.ac.uk/) in Cambridge and was an undergraduate at [Imperial College London](https://www.imperial.ac.uk/life-sciences/). 

I also love to read, you can check out my [bookshelf](https://soo-jeongkim.github.io/bookshelf/) here, and my goodreads [here](https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/147037822-soo-jeong-kim) :)

Write your biography here. Tell the world about yourself. Link to your favorite [subreddit](http://reddit.com). You can put a picture in, too. The code is already in, just name your picture `prof_pic.jpg` and put it in the `img/` folder.

Put your address / P.O. box / other info right below your picture. You can also disable any of these elements by editing `profile` property of the YAML header of your `_pages/about.md`. Edit `_bibliography/papers.bib` and Jekyll will render your [publications page](/al-folio/publications/) automatically.

Link to your social media connections, too. This theme is set up to use [Font Awesome icons](https://fontawesome.com/) and [Academicons](https://jpswalsh.github.io/academicons/), like the ones below. Add your Facebook, Twitter, LinkedIn, Google Scholar, or just disable all of them. -->
